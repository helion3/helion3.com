In 2011 I discovered Minecraft. 

I setup a local server for my son and I, soon a few friends joined, and within weeks I [made it public](http://dhmc.us/ ). Within months the family-friendly atomoshphere and fair rules had attracted thousands. To date we've seen **24,000** players.

Before long I decided to make a custom plugin - something unique the players of our community would enjoy. I've been a professional programmer for nearly fifteen years, but had never done any game-related programming. Over the following three years, I've made around twelve custom plugins - some private, some public, some never used, some used on two thousand other servers.

I decided it was time to take it to the next level, and learn how to write my own game.

I've invested six months of after-hours work, evening brainstorming sessions with my son, and a dozen rewrites of different components as the game and my understanding of game programming evolved.

Today I present to you the first public demo of:

![Lifeform](http://lifeform-game.com/img/branding/logo.png)

*A game of evolution — both natural and mechanical — using biology, genetics, atomic forging, material fabrication, and more!*

You're a cell in a 2d underwater universe, and you must reproduce to gain traits that dictate what you can do. Resources found around the map can be used to construct machines and tools to aide in your evolution.

We're seeking funding on Kickstarter to complete the initial version of Lifeform. The funding will cover art, sound and other professional services we need to bring you a truly unique experience.

If we surpass our goal, the extra will be devoted to kickstarting an iOS version of the game.
