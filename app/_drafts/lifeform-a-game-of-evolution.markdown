In 2011 I discovered Minecraft. 

I setup a local server for my son and I, soon a few friends joined, and within weeks I [made it public](http://dhmc.us/ ). It's family-friendly, has fair and clear rules, and doesn't give preferential treatment to donors. Within months we were hitting 50+ players at once, several hundred a day. To date we've seen **24,000** players.

In order to better shape the experience, I decided to program my own custom plugin. I'd been a professional programmer for a decade but had never worked in Java, the language needed. I'm the type of guy that *has to try*, so I ventured into creating our first original plugin. Once completed, I made another, and another, and too many more.

My most popular plugin has been downloaded 36k times and has an amazing community of users, constantly keeping me company in our IRC channel.

The moment I reach a goal, I look to the next. I used my two years of java experience as a diving board in to building my first stand-alone game.

I've invested six months of after-hours work, evening brainstorming sessions with my son, and a dozen rewrites of different components as both the game itself and my understanding of java and opengl evolved. I've ventured into related programming side projects to help improve my thought process.

Today I present to you the first public demo of:

![Lifeform](http://lifeform-game.com/img/branding/logo.png)

*A game of evolution — both natural and mechanical — using biology, genetics, atomic forging, material fabrication, and more!*

You're a single-cell organism in a vibrant (infinite-map) underwater ecosystem. You're about to encounter countless organisms and creatures - some common, some rare, some friendly, some deadly. All contain genetic traits that your survival will depend on. Through reproduction you need to obtain and evolve these genes - they define how you eat, move, reproduce, and your defensive capabilities.

The Lifeform universe is rich in resources used to forge bio-mechanical components to enhance your organism - including energy production, storage increases, shielding, and much more. As you evolve you'll soon discover the ability to forge new elements by playing at the subatomic level.

Creatures evolve alongside you and as you venture further and further into the world you'll be faced with greater challenges.

We've worked hard over the past year to build a prototype that gives you a sense of the genetic and mechanical evolution aspects. From here, we're ready to *evolve* the game into a complete game, providing hours of unless and dynamic playtime.


## Try the Prototype

Download the game launcher (will which install the latest build of the game and some java graphics libraries it uses):

[Download for PC](http://helion3.s3.amazonaws.com/games/lifeform/lifeform-launcher.jar)

[Download for Mac](http://helion3.s3.amazonaws.com/games/lifeform/lifeform-launcher.dmg)

Mac users: Lifeform has been digitally signed and will work with Gatekeeper.

## Kickstarter

We're seeking funding on Kickstarter to complete the initial version of Lifeform. The funding will cover art, sound and other professional services we need to bring you a truly unique experience.

If we surpass our goal, the extra will be devoted to kickstarting an iOS version of the game.
