> On the brink of extinction, it's enemies bombarded it with everything they had. It only grew stronger as it consumed and used their technology against them.

> Legend says the discovery of several talisman led to the creature's destruction. Its death released a shockwave of matter and energy - scars unerased by the eons since. 

> Life moved on without anyone realizing that a tiny fragment of the creature still drifts through space. It's only now within reach of a new space-faring civilization.

> And it's waking up...

Coming Christmas 2014 for iOS devices.

The Dark Matter Talisman is a space-based, 2D, top-down, infinite world game for iOS devices.

We're hard at work on the game engine, mechanics, and gameplay. Meanwhile, we're integrating amazing artwork for the game content, interface, and menus, and we're working with several artists to bring the important story elements to life.

Expected pricing is around $3.99 for iPad/iPhone.

We'll email you when The Dark Matter Talisman goes on sale:
